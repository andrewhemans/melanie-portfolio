During my time at Elsa L, I designed a lot of frames and templates, but these adorable fantasy frames were by far my favorite templates. It was fun for me to come up with alternative options for each design, while staying within the given specs for each frame. You can see that from design to sample product the designs undergoes multiple changes, which is exciting as a designer to be able to create something fun and visually pleasing while still functional and practical.

Frames such as these were designed to be purchased at stores like Target and Bed Bath and Beyond.
